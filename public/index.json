Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can do it:\nlibrary(dplyr) # Example data frame df \u0026lt;- data.frame( A = 1:5, B = letters[1:5], C = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), D = c(3.5, 2.1, 6.7, 4.2, 8.9) ) # Removing specific columns (e.g., columns B and D) df_removed \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% select(-B, -D) # Displaying the modified data frame print(df_removed) In this example, select(-B, -D) removes columns B and D from the data frame df.

Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can do it:\nShape: You can use different shapes for different categories. This is particularly useful if you\u0026rsquo;re plotting black-and-white graphs or if you have colorblind audiences. # Using shape to segregate data ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, shape = category)) + geom_point() + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Scatter plot of Y against X with segregation by category (shape)\u0026#34;) note there\u0026rsquo;s only like 5 or 6 shapes available so you can only use this when you have \u0026lt;= 5 or 6 categorical item.\nSize: You can vary the size of the points based on a category. # Using size to segregate data ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, size = category)) + geom_point() + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Scatter plot of Y against X with segregation by category (size)\u0026#34;) note it\u0026rsquo;s probably not a good idea to categorize things by size.\nFill: If you\u0026rsquo;re working with shapes that can be filled (e.g., bars), you can use fill to segregate data. # Using fill to segregate data (for filled shapes like bars) ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = category)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Bar plot of Y against X with segregation by category (fill)\u0026#34;) Linetype: If you\u0026rsquo;re working with lines (e.g., line plots), you can vary the line type based on a category. # Using linetype to segregate data (for line plots) ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, linetype = category)) + geom_line() + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Line plot of Y against X with segregation by category (linetype)\u0026#34;) These are just a few examples. Depending on the type of plot and your specific data, you may find other aesthetics more suitable for segregating data.\nAggregating to a Plot To aggregate data before plotting it in a bar chart (or any other chart for that matter), you can use the dplyr package to perform the aggregation operations and then pipe the result into ggplot2 for visualization. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can do it:\nlibrary(dplyr) library(ggplot2) # Example data frame df \u0026lt;- data.frame( category = c(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;), count = c(10, 20, 15, 8, 12, 18) ) # Aggregate the data by category df_aggregated \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(category) %\u0026gt;% summarise(total_count = sum(count)) # Plotting the aggregated data as a bar chart ggplot(df_aggregated, aes(x = category, y = total_count)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + labs(x = \u0026#34;Category\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Total Count\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Aggregated Bar Chart\u0026#34;) In this code:\nWe first use group_by(category) to group the data by the category column. Then, summarise(total_count = sum(count)) calculates the sum of count within each group and creates a new column named total_count. After aggregation, the data is piped into ggplot() for creating the bar chart. geom_bar(stat = \u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;) is used to create the bar chart with the aggregated data. labs(x = \u0026quot;Category\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Total Count\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Aggregated Bar Chart\u0026quot;) sets the labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and the title of the plot.
