[{"content":"Exodus 22:25-27 If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him. If ever you take your neighbor’s cloak in pledge, you shall return it to him before the sun goes down, for that is his only covering, and it is his cloak for his body; in what else shall he sleep? And if he cries to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.\nLeviticus 19:9-15 When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. And you shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the Lord your God. You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one another. You shall not swear by my name falsely, and so profane the name of your God: I am the Lord. You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired worker shall not remain with you all night until the morning. You shall not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I am the Lord. You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.\nLeviticus 19:36-37 You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. And you shall observe all my statutes and all my rules, and do them: I am the Lord.\nLeviticus 25:23-28 The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine. For you are strangers and sojourners with me. And in all the country you possess, you shall allow a redemption of the land. If your brother becomes poor and sells part of his property, then his nearest redeemer shall come and redeem what his brother has sold. If a man has no one to redeem it and then himself becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to redeem it, let him calculate the years since he sold it and pay back the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and then return to his property. But if he does not have sufficient means to recover it, then what he sold shall remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to his property. Leviticus 25:39-41 If your brother becomes poor beside you and sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave: he shall be with you as a hired worker and as a sojourner. He shall serve with you until the year of the jubilee. Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his own clan and return to the possession of his fathers.\nProverbs 31:10-21 An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life. She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands. She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar. She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens. She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night. She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet. Proverbs 10:22 The blessing of the Lord makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.\nProverbs 18:11 A rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and like a high wall in his imagination.\non a side note, this is interesting:\nBefore destruction a man’s heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor. Proverbs 26:13-16 The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road! There is a lion in the streets!” As a door turns on its hinges, so does a sluggard on his bed. The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth. The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly. Jeremiah 22:1-3 Thus says the Lord: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word, and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter these gates. Thus says the Lord: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence to the resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place.\nMark 12:41-44 And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. And he called his disciples to him and said to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.\nMatthew 6:19-34 Lay Up Treasures in Heaven 19 “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 22 “The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, 23 but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! 24 “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\nDo Not Be Anxious 25 “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, 29 yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? 31 Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. 34 “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.\nJames 2:1-4 My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 2For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 3and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 4have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?\nEphesians 4:28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.\n1 Timothy 5:8 But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.\n1 Thessalonians 4:9-12 Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another, for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more, and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/notes-on-passages-about-money-in-the-bible/","summary":"Exodus 22:25-27 If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.

This is particularly useful if you\u0026rsquo;re plotting black-and-white graphs or if you have colorblind audiences. # Using shape to segregate data ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, shape = category)) + geom_point() + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Scatter plot of Y against X with segregation by category (shape)\u0026#34;) note there\u0026rsquo;s only like 5 or 6 shapes available so you can only use this when you have \u0026lt;= 5 or 6 categorical item.\nSize: You can vary the size of the points based on a category. # Using size to segregate data ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, size = category)) + geom_point() + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Scatter plot of Y against X with segregation by category (size)\u0026#34;) note it\u0026rsquo;s probably not a good idea to categorize things by size.\nFill: If you\u0026rsquo;re working with shapes that can be filled (e.g., bars), you can use fill to segregate data. # Using fill to segregate data (for filled shapes like bars) ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = category)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Bar plot of Y against X with segregation by category (fill)\u0026#34;) Linetype: If you\u0026rsquo;re working with lines (e.g., line plots), you can vary the line type based on a category. # Using linetype to segregate data (for line plots) ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, linetype = category)) + geom_line() + labs(x = \u0026#34;X axis label\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Y axis label\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Line plot of Y against X with segregation by category (linetype)\u0026#34;) These are just a few examples. Depending on the type of plot and your specific data, you may find other aesthetics more suitable for segregating data.\nAggregating to a Plot To aggregate data before plotting it in a bar chart (or any other chart for that matter), you can use the dplyr package to perform the aggregation operations and then pipe the result into ggplot2 for visualization. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can do it:\nlibrary(dplyr) library(ggplot2) # Example data frame df \u0026lt;- data.frame( category = c(\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;C\u0026#34;), count = c(10, 20, 15, 8, 12, 18) ) # Aggregate the data by category df_aggregated \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(category) %\u0026gt;% summarise(total_count = sum(count)) # Plotting the aggregated data as a bar chart ggplot(df_aggregated, aes(x = category, y = total_count)) + geom_bar(stat = \u0026#34;identity\u0026#34;) + labs(x = \u0026#34;Category\u0026#34;, y = \u0026#34;Total Count\u0026#34;, title = \u0026#34;Aggregated Bar Chart\u0026#34;) In this code:\nWe first use group_by(category) to group the data by the category column. Then, summarise(total_count = sum(count)) calculates the sum of count within each group and creates a new column named total_count. After aggregation, the data is piped into ggplot() for creating the bar chart. geom_bar(stat = \u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;) is used to create the bar chart with the aggregated data. labs(x = \u0026quot;Category\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Total Count\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;Aggregated Bar Chart\u0026quot;) sets the labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and the title of the plot.
